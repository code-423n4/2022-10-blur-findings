1. Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A cheap way to store constants in a single location is to create an internal constant in a library. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

2. Front-runable initializer

There is nothing preventing another account from calling the initializer before the contract owner. In the best case, the owner is forced to waste gas and re-deploy. In the worst case, the owner does not notice that his/her call reverts, and everyone starts using a contract under the control of an attacker

3. Unsafe use of transferFrom in the function transferERC20().

use require statement to ensure the transfer didn't fail:
